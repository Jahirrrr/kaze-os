# Kaze Operating System

Kaze is a minimal operating system (OS) designed with a simple, in-memory filesystem. The OS is written in a combination of Assembly and C, focusing on providing basic filesystem functionalities, like file creation, reading, writing, listing, and deletion.

</p>

The project simulates a file system in memory, managing files and directories without reliance on external libraries like stdio.h or string.h. A custom kprint function is used for console output.

# Features
- Custom Filesystem: A custom in-memory filesystem that supports file creation, writing, reading, and deletion.
- No Dependency on Standard Libraries: Implemented without the use of stdio.h, string.h, or other C standard libraries.
- Basic Terminal Support: Text output using custom kprint and kprint_newline functions.
- Multiboot Compliant: The OS follows the multiboot specification for booting in an x86 environment.

# Installation and Compilation
## Prerequisites
- NASM: Assembler to compile the assembly code.
- GCC: Cross-compiler for building 32-bit binaries.
- QEMU: Emulator to test the OS in a virtualized environment.

### Compilation Steps
- Install the required tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nasm gcc qemu
```
- Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jahirrrr/kaze-os.git
cd kaze-os
```

- Compile the OS using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```
- Run the OS using QEMU:

```bash
make run
```

- Clean the build files:

```bash
make clean
```

# Usage
## Running in QEMU
After compiling, you can run the OS using the following command:

```bash
make run
```
The OS will boot into a simple console interface, where you can execute the shell commands.
